    <h4>Distance measurement using HY-SR04 Piezo sensor</h4>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>HY-SR04 is a widely available ultrasound ranging module. It
            consists of two 40 kHz Piezo crystals, one acts as a transmitter and
            other as a receiver, and some electronics circuitry to measure the
            time interval between a burst of sound transmitted and the echo
            received.<br>
            The four pins are the power supply, ground, trigger and Echo. This
            module can be connected to ExpEYES-17&nbsp; as shown in the
            schematic, to measure distance between the module and the reflecting
            surface, with an error less than 3mm. This can be used to design
            several experiments in mechanics.<br>

    <h4>The Mass and Spring problem</h4>
    <p>When a mass suspended on a spring is made to oscillate, the period of
      oscillation is given by&nbsp; T = 2 * pi * sqrt( m/k), where m is the mass
      and k is the spring constant. We can measure the period of oscillation by
      measuring the distance to the moving mass as a function of time. The
      distance versus time graph is fitted with a sine function to calculate the
      frequency. The photograph below shows a metal plate suspended on a spring
      and the SR04 facing it from the bottom. The distance to the oscillating
      plate is measured for 5 seconds and the data is fitted to a sine function.</p>

    <h4>Simple Pendulum</h4>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The period of oscillations of a pendulum also can
    be measured using SR04 connected to ExpEYES. The figure shows a pendulum
    with a rectangular bob, but one can use a spherical bob with a piece of
    paper (to provide a flat reflecting surface) pasted to it. The measured
    frequency is 1.05 Hz for a pendulum having a length of 22cm. One can
    calculate the value of acceleration due to gravity from this data.<br>

    <h4>Free Fall, Displacement as a function of Time </h4>
    It is possible to measure the distance to a body falling under gravity. The
    value of 'g' can be calculated by fitting the data with the polynomial<br>
    S(t)= a * t^2 + b * t + c<br>
    'g' is given by 2*a<br>
